Unsupervised learning is a subset of machine learning, but they are not the same thing.

**Machine Learning**: Machine learning is a broader concept that encompasses various techniques and algorithms that enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance on specific tasks over time. Machine learning can be categorized into three main types:

1. **Supervised Learning**: In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on labeled data, where each input is associated with a corresponding target output. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs so that the algorithm can make predictions or classify new, unseen data.
    
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is trained on unlabeled data, and its goal is to find patterns, structures, or relationships in the data without explicit guidance or supervision. Unsupervised learning algorithms are often used for tasks such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.
    
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Reinforcement learning involves training an agent to interact with an environment and learn optimal actions through trial and error. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions, and it adjusts its behavior to maximize cumulative rewards over time.
    

**Unsupervised Learning**: Specifically, unsupervised learning focuses on learning from unlabeled data to uncover hidden patterns or structures. It does not require explicit human supervision or labeled examples. Instead, unsupervised learning algorithms aim to extract meaningful insights from the data, such as grouping similar data points together (clustering) or reducing the dimensionality of the data while preserving important information (dimensionality reduction).

In summary, while unsupervised learning is a part of the broader field of machine learning, it refers specifically to the subset of techniques and algorithms that learn from unlabeled data to uncover patterns or structures without explicit human instructions.
