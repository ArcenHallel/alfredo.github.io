-    Vulnerable to replay attacks
-    Based on a cryptographic hash function and a secret cryptographic key ( Your answer) X 
-    Valid for multiple login sessions

-    ==Not vulnerable to replay attacks ( Your answer)
-    ==Valid for only one login session ( Your answer)

## TOTP
TOTP stands for Time-Based One-Time Password. It's a type of two-factor authentication (2FA) that relies on the generation of a one-time password (OTP) based on the current time and a shared secret between the server and the user's device.

Here's how TOTP works:

1. **Setup**: During the setup process, the user typically scans a QR code or manually enters a secret key provided by the service they're trying to authenticate with. This secret key is securely stored on the user's device and is also stored on the server.

2. **Time-Based Algorithm**: Both the server and the user's device use a time-based algorithm, usually based on the HMAC-SHA-1 or HMAC-SHA-256 cryptographic hash functions, to generate OTPs. The algorithm takes the current time (usually in Unix time, which is the number of seconds elapsed since January 1, 1970) and the shared secret as inputs.

3. **OTP Generation**: When the user needs to authenticate, they provide their username and the current OTP generated by their device. The server independently generates an OTP based on the same time and shared secret. If the OTP provided by the user matches the one generated by the server, authentication is successful.

4. **Validity Window**: To account for differences in time between the user's device and the server, a validity window (typically 30 or 60 seconds) is used. Both the user's device and the server generate OTPs for the current time and a few time steps into the future, allowing for some clock drift.

TOTP is widely used for 2FA in various applications and services, including online banking, email, social media, and corporate networks. It provides an additional layer of security beyond traditional username and password authentication by requiring users to possess both something they know (their password) and something they have (their device capable of generating OTPs).

 2) Which of the following answers refer to the characteristics of HOTP? (Select 3 answers)

-    ==Valid for only one login session ( Missed)
-    Based on a shared secret key and current time ( Your answer) X 
-    Vulnerable to replay attacks
-    ==Based on a cryptographic hash function and a secret cryptographic key ( Your answer)
-    Valid for multiple login sessions ( Your answer) X
-    ==Not vulnerable to replay attacks ( Missed)

## HOTP
HOTP stands for HMAC-based One-Time Password. It's another type of two-factor authentication (2FA) that generates one-time passwords (OTPs) based on a shared secret key and a counter value.

Here's how HOTP works:

1. **Setup**: During the setup process, the user typically scans a QR code or manually enters a secret key provided by the service they're trying to authenticate with. This secret key is securely stored on the user's device and is also stored on the server.

2. **Counter Value**: In addition to the shared secret key, HOTP uses a counter value. This counter is typically stored on both the user's device and the server and is incremented with each authentication attempt.

3. **HMAC Algorithm**: Both the server and the user's device use the HMAC-SHA-1 or HMAC-SHA-256 cryptographic hash function to generate OTPs. The HMAC function takes the shared secret key and the counter value as inputs.

4. **OTP Generation**: When the user needs to authenticate, they provide their username and the current OTP generated by their device. The server independently generates an OTP based on the same counter value and shared secret. If the OTP provided by the user matches the one generated by the server, authentication is successful.

5. **Synchronization**: To ensure that the OTP generated by the user's device matches the one generated by the server, both the device and the server must stay in sync regarding the counter value. This may require periodic synchronization to account for any discrepancies.

HOTP is less commonly used than TOTP but offers similar security benefits. It provides an additional layer of security beyond traditional password-based authentication by requiring users to possess both something they know (their password) and something they have (their device capable of generating OTPs).

3) Which of the following are examples of hardware authentication tokens? (Select 3 answers)

-    ==Key fob ( Your answer)
-    Cable lock
-    Passphrase
-    Biometric reader ( Your answer) X
-    ==RFID badge ( Your answer)
-    ==Smart card ( Missed)

4)  Which of the following is an example of a soft authentication token?

-    USB token
-    ==Authenticator app ( Missed)
-    Smart card
-    Key fob ( Your answer) X

 5) Which of the following does not have an application in the authentication process?

-    One-time passwords
-    SMS messages
-    Hardware / Software tokens
-    Static codes ( Your answer) X 
-    Push notifications
-    Phones
-    ==All of the above can be used in the authentication process ( Missed)

 6) A measure of the likelihood that a biometric security system will incorrectly accept an access attempt by an unauthorized user is known as:

-    CRC
-    ==FAR ( Missed)== FAR False Acceptance Rate
-    CER
-    FRR ( Your answer) X 

7)  A measure of the likelihood that a biometric security system will incorrectly reject an access attempt by an authorized user is referred to as:

-    FAR ( Your answer) X
-    CER
-    CRC
-    ==FRR ( Missed)== FRR False Rejection Rate


8)  Which of the answers listed below refers to a type of metric used for evaluation of a biometric security system's accuracy?

-    FRR
-    CRC ( Your answer) X
-    FAR
-    ==CER ( Missed)==   Cross-over Error Rate

 Your answer to this question is incorrect or incomplete.

The Cross-over Error Rate (CER), also known as Equal Error Rate (EER), is another important metric used for evaluating the performance of biometric security systems. CER represents the point at which the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and the False Rejection Rate (FRR) are equal. 

At the CER point, the probability of falsely accepting an unauthorized user (FAR) is equal to the probability of falsely rejecting an authorized user (FRR). This means that there is an equal likelihood of both types of errors occurring. 

The CER is a crucial metric because it provides a single point of comparison between FAR and FRR, allowing for a direct assessment of the overall accuracy and effectiveness of a biometric authentication system. 

In practice, lower CER values indicate better performance, as they signify a balance between minimizing false acceptances and false rejections. However, it's essential to consider the specific requirements and use cases of the biometric system when interpreting CER values, as different applications may prioritize minimizing different types of errors based on security, usability, and operational considerations.

 confused about this one #study come back to this.
