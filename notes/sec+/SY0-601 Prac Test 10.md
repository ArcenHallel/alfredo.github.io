 1) Hardware RAID Level 1: (Select 3 answers)

-    ==Requires at least 2 drives to implement ( Missed)
-    Is also known as disk striping
-    Offers improved performance in comparison to RAID 0
-    Requires at least 3 drives to implement ( Your answer) X
-    ==Offers improved reliability by creating identical data sets on each drive (failure of one drive does not destroy the array as each drive contains identical copy of the data) ( Your answer)
-    ==Is also referred to as disk mirroring ( Your answer)

2)  Hardware RAID Level 5: (Select 2 answers)

-    Requires at least 2 drives to implement
-    Continues to operate in case of failure of more than 1 drive ( Your answer) X
-    ==Requires at least 3 drives to implement ( Missed)
-    ==Offers increased performance and fault tolerance (single drive failure does not destroy the array and lost data can be re-created by the remaining drives) ( Missed)
-    Requires at least 4 drives to implement ( Your answer) X

3)  Hardware RAID Level 10 (a.k.a. RAID 1+0): (Select 3 answers)

-    ==Requires a minimum of 4 drives to implement ( Missed)
-   ==Is referred to as stripe of mirrors, i.e. a combination of RAID 1 (disk mirroring) and RAID 0 (disk striping) ( Your answer) 
-    Requires a minimum of 5 drives to implement
-    ==Offers increased performance and fault tolerance (failure of one drive in each mirrored pair of disk drives does not destroy the array) ( Missed)
-    Requires a minimum of 3 drives to implement ( Your answer) X
-    Continues to operate in case of failure of more than 2 drives ( Your answer) X

4)  Restoring data from an incremental backup requires: (Select 2 answers)

-    Copy of the last incremental backup ( Your answer) X
-    All copies of differential backups made since the last full backup
-    Copy of the last differential backup ( Your answer) X
-    ==All copies of incremental backups made since the last full backup ( Missed)
-    ==Copy of the last full backup ( Missed)

5)  A file-based representation of the state of a virtual machine at a given point in time is called:

-    Restore point
-    Shadow copy
-    ==Snapshot ( Missed) 
-    System image ( Your answer) X

6)  In a differential backup strategy, restoring data from backup requires only a working copy of the last full backup.

-    True ( Your answer) X
-    ==False ( Missed)

7)  Which of the following answers refers to a sequential-access backup media?

-    ==Magnetic tapes ( Missed)== 
-    Disk drives
-    Optical discs ( Your answer) X
-    Flash media

 8) An exact copy of the entire state of a computer system is known as:

-    ==System image ( Missed)== 
-    Last known-good configuration
-    Restore point ( Your answer) point in time when backup was made and you can back up to
-    Mirrored volume

9)  Which of the following answers refer to the concept of non-persistence? (Select 3 answers)

-    ==Last known-good configuration ( Your answer)
-    System image
-    ==Live boot media ( Missed)
-    Journaling ( Your answer) X
-    ==Known state reversion ( Your answer)

Non-persistence **increases the work factor of adversaries attempting to compromise or breach organizational systems**. Non-persistence can be achieved by refreshing system components, periodically reimaging components, or using a variety of common virtualization techniques.

10)  Examples of embedded systems include: (Select all that apply)

-    Android OS ( Your answer) X phones are not embedded systems (but they are) might be edge computing but for sure smartwatches are considered edge
-    ==Raspberry Pi ( Your answer)
-    iOS ( Your answer) X phones are not embedded systems (but they are )
-    ==Arduino ( Your answer)
-    ==Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) ( Your answer)
-    Mainframe computer system

 Which of the following answers refer to industrial and manufacturing control systems? (Select 2 answers)

-    EDR EDR Endpoint Detection and Response (data lose prevention)
-    CMS CMS Content Management System ( my guess filtering content on systems)
-    ==SCADA ( Your answer)==  supervisory control and data acquisition: gathers, analyzing real-time data to monitor and control equipment that deals with critical and time-sensitive materials.
-    ==ICS ( Your answer)== industrial control systems
-    CCTV CCTV Closed-Circuit Television
